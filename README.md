In this project I went through the given code for the website of a social media marketing company and made some changes to the 
HTML in order to make it more accessible and semantic. This was done by adding alt elements to all of the images with a 
detailed description on what the image was to help those using screen readers. The next hing I did was go through the HTML and 
change many of the tags to be more semantic to help anyone working on this file in the future understand the code with more ease. 
Lastly I had to go through and update the css file to match the changes I made in the HTML so that all styles would be applied properly.
